    WaterWitch features a Raspberry Pi 4 in the enclosure along with a suite of devices. This includes a RP2040 microcontroller,
    ADCs, and electronic speed controllers. As the software co-lead, 
    I contributed to all aspects of the custom-built software package, which allows for real-time control of the ROV.<br><br>

<p id="backend" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Backend</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    Beaumont's backend is built using ROS2 Jazzy.<br><br>

<p id="web-frontend" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Web Frontend</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The web frontend application for piloting WaterWitch was developed in ReactJS and is mainly reused from 2024
    due to its modularity and ease of integration. 
    It features a live video feed viewing, a settings tab for setting
    custom controller mappings, and a control tab for tuning thrust multipliers in certain directions
    and viewing real-time sensor data.<br><br>

<p id="cpp-frontend" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">C++ Frontend</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The C++ frontend application for piloting WaterWitch was developed in C++ as an alternative to the web frontend.
    Although the web frontend makes it possible to control the ROV from any device with a web browser, the C++ frontend
    was developed for lower latency, quicker development, and more direct control (bypassing ROSlibJS and ROSBridgeServer).<br><br>
    The C++ frontend may either be used as a command-line or graphical application. The graphical application is built using

<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The simulation environment was developed as a independent project intended to be used beyond the 2025 competition year.

<p id="streaming-configuration" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Streaming Configuration</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    WaterWitch's live view feed is streamed from the ROV's Raspberry Pi 4 and two aditional Raspberry Pi 
    Zero 2Ws housed in their own enclosures.<br><br>The streaming configuration is done with minimal cabling and
    doesn't require an ethernet hat on the Pi Zero 2Ws nor an ethernet switch in the main enclosure. Instead,
    the Pi 4 acts as a switch by connecting to the Pi Zero 2Ws over USB.
