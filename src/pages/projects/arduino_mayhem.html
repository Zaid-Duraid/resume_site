    As a project for a first year engineering course, I made a game with a friend that utilizes an arudino grove beginner kit and 
    several Python libraries.

    See this project's repository</a><br><br>

    The game included six puzzle levels with custom assests, an amusing storyline, and many scenarios, for an ~15 minute playthrough. 
    Overall, Arduino Mayhem! won a first place prize in the class competition.
