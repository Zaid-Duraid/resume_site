    As a project for a first year engineering course, me and a team of three other students made a hypothetical 
    drone racing ring to be used in an FPV drone competition.

    The aim of the project was moreso to learn about the engineering design process, rather than to create a
    functional product. However, the design and associated code were tested in the Gazebo Classic 11 simulator,
    and some prototype models were made.
