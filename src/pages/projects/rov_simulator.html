    This project demonstrates an implementation of Gazebo Harmonic [1] for simulating underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Its purpose 
    is to facilitate simulation of underwater ROVs as quickly as possible using open source software. This may help to improve safety, promote the
    development of advanced features autonomous driving features, and increase testing time. <a class="link-underline-primary Link-hover-opacity-50" href="#references">

    I initally built a simulation environment as part of the 2024 Eastern Edge Robotics Software Package.
    It was built using plugins included in Gazebo Classic 11. I figured that, if only 
    the simulation environment was available earlier in the competition season, or developed using more tailored plugins and models,
    it could have been even more useful.<br><br>

    You can always use a box or cylinder (i.e, arbitrary object) as a placeholder for your ROV. However, importing a model is nice 
    because it allows you to visualize your ROV and have an accurate collision mesh. The following in a model of Eastern Edge Robotics' 
    2024 ROV, Beaumont, designed in Onshape:

    You can look at the Gazebo documentation [1] or this project's repository [2] to see how to import a CAD model. You'll see that
    models and worlds are defined in Simulation Desription Format (SDF) files, which are XML files that make it easy to edit 
    your robot model.<br><br>
    
    Here, Beaumont was exported as an STL file from onshape (with units in meters). After attaching additional links for the propellers 
    and claw (more details coming in the <a class="link-underline-primary Link-hover-opacity-50" href="#implementing-plugins">plugins</a> section), the model looked like this:

    At this point, you can set your ROV's mass, center of mass, and mass moments of inertia parameters.
    You may obtain these values through measurements or CAD software. The robot building tutorial in the 
    Gazebo documentation [1] shows how to set the inertial parameters in your model's SDF file. <br><br>

    Moving requires you to simulate all the forces acting on your ROV. Except for gravity, these forces can 
    be simulated through plugins.

    In addition to the general documentation [1], Gazebo Sim's API Reference [3] is a great resource for understanding everything mentioned in the guide and beyond.
    The source code of the built-in Gazebo plugins [4] can also be helpful.<br><br>

<p id="buoyancy" class="text-primary h3 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Buoyancy</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The buoyant force is calculated by Archimedes' Principle:<br>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\[ F_b = \rho \cdot g \cdot V \]</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">Where \( F_b \) is the buoyant force, \( \rho \) is fluid density, \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity, and \( V \) is volume of displaced fluid</span><br>
    The buoyant force acts on your ROV's overall center of volume (where "your ROV" also includes everything attached to your ROV, such as any external buoyancy foam or tools).<br><br>
    In the case of Beaumont, this can be estimated as approximately the center of the electronic enclosure.

<div class="text-center">

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    
    The built-in Gazebo buoyancy plugin will apply a force based on the volume and center of volume of the collision elements of your models' links [4][5]. 
    Ultimately, this will require you to create arbitrary collision elements inside of your models for the purposes of buoyancy. To get around this,
    this project's custom buoyancy plugin allows you to manually specify the volume and center of volume of your ROV 
    (as well as other objects) in your world SDF file [1].<br><br>

    You may plan to add foam or weights to your ROV to achieve your desired neutral or negative/positive buoyancy. The effect of these additions
    can also be simulated by fixing extra links to your ROV model. Then, you can accordingly define these links' inertial and custom buoyancy plugin volume
    parameters in your model and world SDF files.

<p id="thrust" class="text-primary h3 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Thrust</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    A critical step in the development of your ROV is translating the pilot's commands (ex., surge forward, yaw left) into 
    the values that will be sent to each of your ROV's thrusters. By simulating thrusters, you can test and tune your control algorithms
    before moving forward with your thruster layout.<br><br>
</p>
<div class="text-center">

    <p class="text-secondary fs-6 mt-2">Beaumont's omnidirectional thruster layout</p>
</div>
<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The first step to simulating thrusters is to position them correctly around your ROV. An effective approach is to include the thruster body as part of
    you main CAD model. Then, you can create seperate CAD models for your propellers. Finally, you can attach your propeller link to the thruster body using
    revolute joints in your model's SDF file.<br><br>
</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img class="img-fluid rounded ms-2 ps-2 w-md-40" src="../public/rov_simulator/beaumont_propeller_joints.png" alt="Beaumont's propeller joints"/>
    <p class="text-secondary fs-6 mt-2">Beaumont's propeller joints</p>
</div>
<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The second step to simulating thrusters is to use a thruster plugin. Gazebo's built-in thruster plugin allows you to specify the force or angular 
    velocity that will be applied to each thruster you add through publishing to Gazebo topics [3][4]. Gazebo topics can be bridged to ROS2 topics by running 
    a simple parmeter bridge command [1], as is done in this project's repository [2].<br><br>

    You may be controlling your real ROV's thrusters by communicating with a chip or microcontroller that sends, for example, PWM signals to your thrusters.
    This means that, for simulation, you may have to add functionality in your control code to determine the force that should be applied by a given thruster.<br><br>

    While the approach above works, it's preferable to minimize changes to your ROV's control code, keeping it separate from major simulation-related workarounds. Therefore, this 
    project's custom thruster plugin includes an additional operation mode that can be specified in the model's SDF file [2]. This new operation mode expects an input from 1-255 on each 
    thruster's gazebo topic. Then, using official Blue Robotics T200 Thruster data [6] and a provided voltage mode, the input is mapped to the expected thrust.
    The mapping range is as follows:
</p>
<ul class="text-secondary fs-6 lh-lg dynamic_size_text">
    <li>Input = 1 -> PWM Value = ~1100us (max forward thrust)</li>
    <li>Input = 127 -> PWM Value = 1500us (no thrust)</li>
    <li>Input = 255 -> PWM Value = 1900us (max backward thrust)</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The benefit is that you can do the following in your real ROV's control code:
</p>

<div class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    <pre><code class="language-python">
    if simulation_mode:
        thruster_topics[thruster].publish(thrust_value[thruster])
    else:
        # In this example, we are controlling our real ROV's thrusters by communicating with a microcontroller on the i2c bus
        bus.write_byte_data(MICROCONTROLLER_ADDRESS, THRUSTER_CHANNELS[thruster], thrust_value[thruster]) 
    </code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The custom thruster plugin's new operation mode also simulates the ramp-up speed of the thrusters in response to input commands [2]. This ensures
    that the thrusters do not instantaneously reach the input speeds, providing a more realistic simulation.<br><br>
    
    The ramp up emulation is done in the code through PID control. You can modifiy the PID parameters in your model's SDF file.<br><br>
    
    Of course, this custom thruster plugin's code can also be modified to expect different input values or mimic another thruster.

<p id="hydrodynamics" class="text-primary h3 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Hydrodynamics</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    Hydrodynamic forces and moments other than buoyancy (those due to added mass and hydrodynamic damping) can be estimated through Gazebo's built-in hydrodynamics plugin. The plugin requires many SDF parameters specifc to your 
    ROV. To simulate your ROV quickly, these parameters can be imported from another ROV or based on what feels right. The theory for this plugin can be found in the Gazebo Sim API Reference [3].

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    If you want accurately simulate your ROV's hydrodynamics, you'll need to analyze your ROV further.<br><br>
    
    The ideas presented here are inspired by Thor Foseen's Book "Guidance and Control of Ocean Vehicles" [7]. <br><br>
    On page 32, you'll find the following equation:
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\[ \mathbf{M}\dot{\nu}+\mathbf{C}(\nu)\nu+\mathbf{D}(\nu)\nu+g(\eta)=\tau_{E}+\tau \]</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">Where:</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \mathbf{M} \) is the ROV's rigid body inertia matrix + added mass inertia matrix,</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \nu \) is the ROV's velocity vector in a body-fixed reference frame, containing linear and angular velocities,</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \dot{\nu} \) is the time derivative of \( \nu \),</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \mathbf{C}(\nu)\nu \) is the Coriolis and Centripetal forces and moments containing seperate terms for the rigid-body and added mass inertia matrices</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \mathbf{D}(\nu)\nu \) is the linear and quadratic damping forces and moments,</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( g(\eta) \) is the the restoring forces and moments (i.e. gravity and buoyancy),</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \tau_{E} \) is the combined environmental forces and moments,</span>
    <span class="text-primary text-center d-block">\( \tau \) is the thruster propultion forces and moments</span><br>

    The equation is introduced and explored in Fossen's book [7]. You don't need to interact with this equation directly. The key takeway for simulating your ROV's hydrodynamics 
    is a fill-in-the-blank approach.<br><br>

    Up to this point (before the hydrodynamics plugin), you've already filled in the blanks for: 
</p>
<ul class="text-secondary fs-6 lh-lg dynamic_size_text">
    <li>The rigid body intertia matrix terms of <span class="text-primary">\( \mathbf{M}\dot{\nu}+\mathbf{C}(\nu)\nu \)</span> by <a class="link-underline-primary Link-hover-opacity-50" href="#setting-inertial-parameters">settings your inertial parameters<a></a></li>

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    <span class="text-primary">\( \tau_{E} \)</span> (waves, wind, ocean current - see Fossen Chapter three [7]) will be ignored in this simulation environment; They can be simulated through other plugins.<br><br>
    
    That leaves only <span class="text-primary">\( \mathbf{D}(\nu)\nu \)</span> and the added mass matrix terms of <span class="text-primary">\( \mathbf{M}\dot{\nu}+\mathbf{C}(\nu)\nu \)</span>. This is what 
    Gazebo's hydrodynamics plugin simulates [8].<br><br>

    The added mass inertia matrix is based on your ROV's geometry. It can be estimated using a Python library called Capytaine [8][9][10]. Specifically, the Capytaine docs provide a direct example on 
    how to estimate the added mass inertia matrix of a rigid body, which is replicated in a script in this project [2]. You can use a simplified ROV model's STL file after ensuring that it captures the geometric features 
    of your ROV, as complex models are "compuationally prohibitive" [8] (I can confim).<br><br>

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    You'll notice that the hydrodynamics plugin only accepts six terms for added mass [8], although the added mass matrix contains 36 terms. From Fossen pg. 37, a slow moving ROV with three planes of symmetry 
    can be assumed to have a diagonal added mass inertia matrix [7]. Off diagonal elements can be added to the plugin, if so desired, for ROV's like Beaumont that lack a perfect 3-axis symmetry.<br><br>

    Simulating cameras allows you to test your camera positions, orientations, camera joint manipulation code, image processing code, and of course 
    simulated piloting of your ROV. You'll need to include Gazebo's sensors system plugin in your world SDF file. Following that, cameras can be included as sensors
    within links in your model's SDF file. There are many Camera features you can tune in SDF [1][4]. You can even render camera streams while running the simulation in headless mode [12]<br><br>

<p class="text-secondary fs-6 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    This project's repository includes a custom claws plugin [2], inspired by Beaumont's linear actuator claw design. For this plugin, you'll need two links (right and left claw) connected 
    to your model through revolute joints (see the robot building tutorial [1]). For each claw, you can specify a maximum inward and outward rotation in your model's SDF file. 
    Finally, you can publish the desired claws velocity to the claws' Gazebo topic (or ROS2 topic once bridged).<br><br>
