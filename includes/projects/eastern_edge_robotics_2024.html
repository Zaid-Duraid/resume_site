    Beaumont features a Raspberry Pi 4 in the enclosure along with a suite of devices including microcontrollers,
    ADCs, temperature sensors, electronic speed controllers, and DC motors. As the software lead, 
    I contributed to all aspects of the custom-built software package, which allows for real-time control of the ROV.<br><br>

<p id="backend" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Backend</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    Beaumont's backend is built using ROS2 Humble and contains several nodes written in Python. 
    They perform the following jobs: 
</p>
<ul class="text-secondary fs-5 lh-lg dynamic_size_text">
    <li>Listening for pilot input and performing necessary thruster math</li>
    <li>Publishing control commands on the control board's i2c bus or, in the 
        case of the simulation, on Gazebo topics</li>
    <li>Obtaining and publishing imu, voltage, and temperature data to the frontend</li>
    <li>Storing and loading configuration data and real-time progress during competition runs</li>
    <li>Autonomously controlling Beaumont for the "Brain Coral Transplant" 2024 competition task</li>
</ul>

<p id="frontend" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Frontend</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The frontend web application for piloting Beaumont was developed in ReactJS. 
    It features a live video feed from the ROV's four cameras, a settings tab for setting
    custom controller mappings, and a control tab for tuning thrust multipliers in certain directions
    and viewing real-time sensor data. Overall, it makes it possible to pilot the ROV using any device 
    with a web browser.

<p id="simulation" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Simulation</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    The simulation here, based on Gazebo Classic 11, was developed as part of the software 2024 repository. It 
    was used for developing other parts of software package in absence of a physical ROV, 
    planning around mission tasks, pilot practice, and team demos.<br><br>
    Overall, the simulation integrates seamlessly with the backend and frontend, providing a version of Beaumont 
    that has thrust, claws, and four cameras streamed over mjpeg. The simulation environment also features a world that includes
    the majority of the 2024 competition tasks.

<p id="streaming-configuration" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Streaming Configuration</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    Beaumont's live view feed is streamed from the ROV's Raspberry Pi 4 and three aditional Raspberry Pi 
    Zero 2Ws housed in their own enclosures. Streaming was done using a open source mjpeg streamer for the Picamera2
    called <a class="link-underline-primary Link-hover-opacity-50"

<p id="deployment" class="text-primary h2 my-3 mx-2 dynamic_size_text">Deployment</p>
<p class="text-secondary fs-5 m-2 dynamic_size_text">
    To ease deployement, both the backend and frontend were dockerized. The entire package could be installed
    on a fresh Raspberry Pi 4 using a single install script.
