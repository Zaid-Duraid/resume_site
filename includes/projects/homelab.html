    I have a homelab which I use regularly for learning technologies, doing projects, and running self-hosted services.
    The setup consists of a proxmox server running virutal machines along with additional computers running other services. <br><br>

    One of these services is a remote development machine for <a class="link-underline-primary Link-hover-opacity-50" href="experience.html">Eastern Edge Robotics</a> software team members running the team's software stack 
    and the ROV simulation environment. The machine is hosted using Tailscale.
